# Blockchain Explorer

Blockchain Explorer is a developer-friendly tool designed to simplify the process of developing and debugging smart contracts. Inspired by tools like Ganache, this project provides a user-friendly interface to visualize and interact with the blockchain network. Unlike traditional frameworks like Hardhat, which rely on logs, Blockchain Explorer offers a comprehensive UI to help developers better understand the current state of the blockchain.

## Features

- **Default Network Connection**: Connects to the default Ethereum JSON-RPC URL (`http://127.0.0.1:8545/`) out of the box.
- **Customizable RPC URL**: Users can easily update the RPC URL from the top page to connect to their preferred network.
- **Visualize Blockchain Data**:
  - View recent blocks and their details.
  - Explore transactions and their metadata.
  - Monitor events and logs emitted by smart contracts.
  - Manage accounts and contracts.
- **Developer-Friendly**: Built with [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), ensuring a modern and efficient development experience.
